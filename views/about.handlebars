        <p class="title">Welcome to the Pup Fridays at SPICED Petition</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Fridays are already great, but what better way to make them even greater by introducing <strong>Pup Fridays at SPICED</strong>? I am petitioning to have a dog adoption organization visit the school every Friday with pups to bring joy to all students and staff.</p>
