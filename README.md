# Petition

## Live Website

## Overview

This project was one of my favorites during my time in SPICED Academy!

The project's goal was creating an online petition where supporters can register, log in, update profile information, provide their signature, redo their signature, and view a list of fellow supporters, those who signed thus far and sorted by location.

The cause for this particular petition was advocating for dogs from an adoption organization to visit SPICED Academy every Friday to bring joy to students and staff and assist in stress-relief.

## Features

-   Registration and login is possible as part of the functionality.
-   User security is provided by utilizing bcrypt to protect the users' password.
-   Enables user to update their profile at any time saving the latest information in the database and rendering the updated information immediately.
-   Users are able to redo their signatures.
-   On the signature page, a few research studies are quoted regarding the correlation of therapy dogs and stress relief. The user can click on each study where a new tab will open displaying the source of the quote as well as additional information.
-   Users are able to sort list of supporters by city as well as access their provided url websites, if available, by clicking on any name.
